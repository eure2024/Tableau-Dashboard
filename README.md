# Tableau-Dashboard

I created the interactive dashboard by following instructions in the Practical Tableau textbook by Ryan Sleeper. 

I imported the data by connecting to an external database and created the data visualizations by dragging the fields to the shelves and marks card to create custom graphs and charts. After creating the data visualizations, I connected the dashboard to Tableau Public.
